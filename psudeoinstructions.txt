Speed

remove the jokers
create four piles of cards face down next to eachother
place four cards in each of the outer two piles
place one card in each of the inner two piles
deal out the remaining cards to two players(each should have 21 cards)
each player must then deal themselves a hand of five cards from the cards they have just received
players must always have five cards in their hand
flip the center two cards at the same time
cards must be placed in the order Ace,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,Jack,Queen,King,Ace or Ace,King,Queen,Jack,10,9,8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1,Ace

While both players still have cards in their hand:
  The player must play cards that fit either squence from the their hand
  Once a player plays a card they must draw another card from the pile they have been dealt
  if there are no longer any cards left in the pile:
    the player does not need to draw cards anymore
  If neither player can make a move:
    both players must each take a card from one of the outer piles
    they must place the card face down on one of the middle piles
    then they must flip the cards over at the same time
if a player runs out of cards first, they must place both hands down on the center two piles and say "Speed":
  then the other player must stop plying their cards
  the game is now over
